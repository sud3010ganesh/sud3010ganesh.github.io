I'm Sudharsan, a Data Science professional with a Masters in Business Analytics from the National University of Singapore (NUS). Prior to my Masters, I have worked with one of the world's largest pure-play analytics firms for 2 years and helped solve problems for Fortune 500 clients across e-commerce, retail and financial services domains. I have worked on problems that required definition of problem scope, data cleaning, data exploration and data visualization, selection and tuning machine learning models. The tools I have used during my stint at work include R, Python, Tableau, SAS Enterprise Guide, SAS Enterprise Miner and SQL.

My current topics of interest include Natural Language Processing, Causal Inference, Time Series Forecasting, Recommender Systems and Risk Management.

In my spare time, I play tennis, watch Football and backpack to pristine locations. I have also worked with a NGO that uses data to drive women safety initiatives to leverage my analytics skills for a social cause.

I strongly believe in the principle of Learning over Knowing. I am constantly on the lookout to discuss and learn from new people about data science, tennis, football and travel over a cup of coffee. Feel free to shoot me an email at sud3010ganesh@gmail.com
