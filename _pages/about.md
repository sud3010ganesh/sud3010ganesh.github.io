I'm Sudharsan, and I currently work as a Sr. Data Scientist in Dyson. At Dyson I work with the centralized analytics team and
work on problems that span across different business functions and markets. I also hold a Masters in Business Analytics from the
National University of Singapore (NUS). Prior to my Masters, I have worked with one of the world's largest pure-play analytics firms for
2 years and helped solve problems for Fortune 500 clients across e-commerce, retail and financial services domains.

I have worked across the end-to-end problem lifecycle from problem scoping, data gathering, exploration and visualization to
development and deployment of ML models. The tools I have used during my stint at work include R, Python, Tableau, SAS Enterprise Guide,
and SQL. I have prior experience of working with cloud platforms including GCP and AWS. My current topics of interest include
Natural Language Processing, Time Series Forecasting and Recommender Systems.

I have also been a part of the team that won the top spot at the NUS Business Analytics Innovation Challenge held in 2017.

In my spare time, I play tennis, watch football and backpack to pristine locations. I have also been involved with a NGO that
uses data to drive women safety initiatives to leverage my analytics skills for a social cause.

I strongly believe in the principle of Learning over Knowing. I am constantly on the lookout to discuss and learn from new people
about data science, tennis, football and travel over a cup of coffee. Feel free to shoot me an email at sud3010ganesh@gmail.com
